# TomS-PhotoViewer
A Windows app for viewing photos and info-including a variety of random viewing choices (written in LispWorks Lisp).
Just download the compiled version, put on the desktop (or wherever), andf run.  The menu's and buttons are self-explanatory. It allows modes of viewing (select photos manually, slide-show, etc).  The real purpose of the program was to allow the user to view photos randomly by folder or by individual photo.  I like to view them by folder, since my photos are arranged by dates/events so that it will choose a particular folder, then I can see all the photos in the folder. At the bottom is the time, date, filename, etc.  It is also possible to vary the viewing time, click on a button to save a photo to a pre-assigned folder, and other features.  I have thousands of photos in my collection, and it will work on them for quite a long time until it crashes from overload the buffers I guess.  But no worry, just restart the program and it works for a few more hours. Currently, I am uploading the files.  I will include the source code for those who want to modify it for their own uses.  I would appreciate feedback about any improvements.  I would particularly like to add code to run video files (.mov especially) which could be mixed in with the photos.  Currently, it just skips them.
