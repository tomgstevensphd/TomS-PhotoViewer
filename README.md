# TomS-PhotoViewer
A Windows app for viewing photos and info-including a variety of random viewing choices (written in LispWorks Lisp).
Just download the compiled version, put on the desktop (or wherever), and run.  The menu's and buttons are self-explanatory. It allows modes of viewing (select photos manually, slide-show, etc). 

MAIN PURPOSE/FEATURE: The real purpose of the program was to allow the user to view photos randomly by folder or by individual photo.  I like to view them by folder, since my photos are arranged by dates/events so that it will choose a particular folder, then I can see all the photos in the folder in the order they are listed. 

OTHER FEATURES: At the bottom of the window is the time, date, filename, etc.  
It is also possible to vary the viewing time, click on a button to save a photo to a pre-assigned folder, and other features. 

IT WORKS: I have thousands of photos in my collection, and it will work on them for quite a long time until it crashes from overload the buffers I guess.  But no worry, just restart the program and it works for a few more hours. Currently, I am uploading the files.

SOURCE CODE: I will include the source code for those who want to modify it for their own uses.  I would appreciate feedback about any improvements.  

FUTURE: I would particularly like to add code to run video files (.mov especially) which could be mixed in with the photos.  Currently, it just skips them. IF ANYONE CAN OFFER SUGGESTIONS ABOUT GETTING/INTEGRATING CODECS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

The graphical interface for this program is LispWorks' CAPI You must however have LispWorks to run CAPI.  A personal version can be downloaded free from lispworks.com. You can run the program from the source code or compile it.
